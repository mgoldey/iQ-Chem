iQ-Chem
=======

Q-Chem scripts, iPython notebooks, and other utilities

Dependencies:  iPython, matplotlib, pylab (numpy, scipy, etc.)

Current lay-out:

useful_scripts:
	This contains scripts that I`ve made and found useful over the past few years.  These are not fancily formatted, but I am hoping to merge these with a more general framework in time.

notebook:
	This contains an example notebook to demonstrate the functionality implemented so far
